üöÄ Project showcase @ MotionCut: To-Do List Application! üìù

I'm thrilled to share my latest Python project‚Äîa robust To-Do List Application designed to boost productivity and streamline task management. This project offers a choice between a command-line interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) for added versatility.

Key Features:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Add Tasks: Seamlessly add new tasks to your to-do list. Each task can be enriched with a description, due date, and priority, making it easy to stay organized and on top of your goals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Task List Display: Enjoy a user-friendly feature that presents your tasks with all the essential details, including descriptions, due dates, and priorities.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Task Completion: Keep track of your accomplishments by marking tasks as completed. The application moves them to a separate list, offering a clear overview of your progress.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Update Tasks: Adapt to changing priorities and evolving requirements by allowing users to update task descriptions, due dates, or priorities.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Tasks: Streamline your list by implementing the option to remove tasks that are no longer needed.

Whether you opt for the simplicity of the command-line interface or the user-friendly experience of the GUI, this project is designed to meet your needs and enhance your daily task management.
